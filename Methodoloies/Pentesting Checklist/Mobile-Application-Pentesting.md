## Mobile Application Testing Process
We Follow Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Top 10 (but not limited to) for our Mobile application  security  testing Process 

1. Static Testing:
    - Implicit Intent Security Issues
    - Web View Vulnerabilities
    - setAllowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs enabled for a Web View
    - JavaScript Enabled for a web view.

2. Application Testing:
 - Improper Platform Usage
    - Check for Violation of published guidelines 
    - Check for Violation of common practice 
    - Unintentional misuse

- Insecure Data Storage
   - Insufficient file data protection
   - Hardcoded password leakage in logs. 

- Insecure Communication:
    - Check for SSL pinning bypasses
    - Poor handshaking/weak negotiation,
    - Incorrect SSL versions,
    - Cleartext communication of sensitive assets
    - HTTP instead of HTTPS

- Insecure Authentication
    - Weaknesses in session management
    - No rate limiting. 
    - 2fa bypass. 
    - Weak passwords.

- Sufficient Cryptography
  - Check for outdated cryptographic algorithm or weak cryptographic algorithm

- Insecure Authorization
    - Check for Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerabilities
    - Check for Hidden Endpoints
    - Test User Role or Permission Transmissions

- Client Code Quality
  - Buffer overflows
  - Format string vulnerabilities
- Code Tampering
  - Binary patching
  - Local resource modification
  - Method hooking and swizzling

- Reverse Engineering
  - Decompile the app and analyze the source code using Jadx tool .

- Extraneous Functionality
  - Hidden backdoor functionality.
  - Other internal development security controls not intended for production environments.
  
## Essential Tools for Mobile Penetration Testing
This compilation provides an overview of the primary tools employed in the penetration testing of web and mobile applications. It's important to recognize that the array of instruments available to a penetration tester is broad and adaptable, and extends beyond the ones mentioned here. This flexibility allows for a more bespoke approach, customized to suit the distinct requirements of each unique web or mobile application testing environment.
1. **Information Gathering Tools**:
   - Nmap: An open-source tool for network exploration and security auditing.
   - Shodan: A search engine that lets the user find specific types of computers connected to the internet using a variety of filters.
   - theHarvester: A tool for gathering e-mail accounts, subdomain names, virtual hosts, open ports/ banners, and employee names from different public sources.
   - Maltego: An open-source intelligence and forensics application, providing a library of transforms for the discovery of data from open sources and visualizing that information in a graph format.
2. **Mobile Application Testing Tools**:
   - Drozer: A comprehensive security and attack framework for Android.
   - Frida: A dynamic instrumentation toolkit for developers, reverse-engineers, and security researchers.
   - MobSF (Mobile Security Framework): An automated, all-in-one mobile application (Android/iOS/Windows) pen-testing, malware analysis, and security assessment framework.
3. **Exploitation Tools**:
   - Metasploit: An extremely popular framework that contains a suite of tools for conducting extensive security testing.
