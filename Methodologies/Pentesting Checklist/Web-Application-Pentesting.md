## Web application Testing Process
We Follow the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Top 10 (but not limited to)  for  our Web application security testing Process.

1. **Static Testing:**
- Use Cases Requirements Validation Checklists
- Functional Requirements Validation Checklist
- Prototype/ Screen Mock-up Validation Checklist
- Field Dictionary Validation Checklist
- Architecture Review Checklist

2. **Network/Cloud Testing:**
- Nmap for network scanning , identify which ports are open and what services are running on them and then try to exploit them if they are vulnerable
- Network Sniffing Attack
- Identify the services running on cloud if aws then check for misconfiguration in:
  - EC2
  - s3 Buckets
  - Lambda
  - IAM
  - RDS
  - Cloud Formation
  - Guard Duty
  - ECR

3. **Application Testing** (This covers both client and server side bugs)
- Injection 
    - Code injection
    - CRLF injection
    - Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
    - Email Header Injection
    - Hyperlink injection
    - Host Header Injection
    - LDAP injection
    - OS command injection
    - SQLi injection
    - XPath injection
    - Html injection
    - Server-Side Injection
  
- Broken authentication
    - credential stuffing
    - Application session timeouts aren't set properly.
    - Passwords are not properly hashed and salted
    - No rate limiting. 
    - 2fa bypasses
    - Sensitive data exposure
    - S3 bucket publicly accessible in js files etc. 
    - Api key disclosures on js file or on github
    - Hardcoded pass or any sensitive data publicly accessible on github or in js files. 
    - Sensitive directory listing. 
    - Google Dorking. 

- XML external entities (XXE)
    - Exploit XXE using external entities to retrieve files. 
    - Exploit XXE via image file upload
    - Exploit XXE to perform SSRF attacks

- Broken access control
    - Vertical privilege escalation
    - Horizontal privilege escalation
    - Horizontal to vertical privilege escalation
    - Insecure direct object references
    - Access control vulnerabilities in multi-step processes
    - Referrer-based access control

- Security misconfigurations
    - Unpatched flaws
    - Default configurations /Default/ out of the box account settings (i.e. usernames and passwords)
    - Unused pages
    - Unprotected files and directories
    - Unnecessary services
    - Unencrypted files
    - Insufficient firewall protection
    - Verbose Errors
    - Cross site scripting (XSS)
    - Stored XSS. 
    - Reflected Xss. 
    - Dom based XSS
    - Insecure deserialization


- Using components with known vulnerabilities
  - Find component which is vulnerable using web app scanning tools(Nessus, Burp suite active scan ++)

- Insufficient logging and monitoring
  - Check for lack of proper log format, context, storage, security 
  - Check whether a timely response to detect an incident is implemented or not.

- **API Testing**:
  - Broken Object Level Authorization
  - Broken User Authentication
  - Excessive Data Exposure
  - Lack of Resources & Rate Limiting
  - Broken Function Level Authorization
  - Mass Assignment
  - Security Misconfiguration
  - Injection
  - Improper Assets Management
  - Insufficient Logging & Monitoring

## Essential Tools for Web Penetration Testing
This compilation provides an overview of the primary tools employed in the penetration testing of web and mobile applications. It's important to recognize that the array of instruments available to a penetration tester is broad and adaptable, and extends beyond the ones mentioned here. This flexibility allows for a more bespoke approach, customized to suit the distinct requirements of each unique web or mobile application testing environment.
1. **Information Gathering Tools**:
   - Nmap: An open-source tool for network exploration and security auditing.
   - Shodan: A search engine that lets the user find specific types of computers connected to the internet using a variety of filters.
   - theHarvester: A tool for gathering e-mail accounts, subdomain names, virtual hosts, open ports/ banners, and employee names from different public sources.
   - Maltego: An open-source intelligence and forensics application, providing a library of transforms for the discovery of data from open sources and visualizing that information in a graph format.

2. **Web Application Testing Tools**:
   - OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy): An open-source web application security scanner.
   - Burp Suite: An integrated platform for performing security testing of web applications.
   - Nikto: An open-source web server scanner.
   - SQLmap: An open-source penetration testing tool that automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws.
  
3. **Exploitation Tools**:
   - Metasploit: An extremely popular framework that contains a suite of tools for conducting extensive security testing.
