## What is Invariant development ?
Invariant development is a critical methodology for enhancing the reliability and security of smart contracts through the rigorous application of invariants. Invariants are conditions, truths or facts that remain constant across the execution of a smart contract, ensuring its behavior aligns with intended logic and security protocols. This discipline is essential in the blockchain ecosystem, where the immutable nature of smart contracts demands absolute correctness to prevent vulnerabilities and undefined behaviiours.

## Our Methodology
1. Invariant Identification
   - The initial phase involves a comprehensive review of all available documentation related to the protocol, including whitepapers, protocol documentation, code annotations, and diagrams.
   - Once a foundational understanding is established, an architectural overview meeting is arranged with the protocol's development team to discern both system-wide and developer-specific assumptions.
   - Expertise is then applied to discern all protocol invariants, with each being assessed and assigned a risk score and priority level.
3. Invariant Implementation
   Once invariants have been pinpointed, the next step involves translating these invariants into Solidity code. This process includes carefully planning and structuring a protocol-specific boilerplate, which entails the creation of relevant Handlers and wrappers. Concurrently, a fuzzing environment is set up to facilitate thorough testing.
5. Invariant Testing & Integration
   Invariants are executed both locally and on specialized cloud infrastructure. Specifications are refined following fuzz run outcomes, with arithmetic bounds identified and preconditions adjusted to mirror realistic scenarios. Cooperation with the development team facilitates the integration of fuzzing into the CI process, such as via GitHub actions, for short-term fuzzing campaigns. Additionally, guidance is offered on conducting long-term fuzzing campaigns, either locally or through cloud platforms.
7. Training & Guidance
   Assistance is provided to the developer team by offering comprehensive guidance, sharing insights, and implementing best practices to navigate through the complexities of the development process efficiently.

Fuzzing is a time-consuming process that demands patience, meticulous planning, and a strategic approach to yield comprehensive and meaningful results.
